# Sonic Range Finder Edge Detection

This is a real-time application running on top of ErikaOS (Real-time operating system) on a STM32F4-Discovery board.
This application uses the data acquired from the sonic range finder SRF08 to display the edge of the obstacles encountered while moving on a cart.

## Getting Started

In order to compile the application, you need:

* [Erika Enterprise](http://erika.tuxfamily.org/drupal/download.html) - OS used on top of the STM32F4-Discovery board.

I suggest to download the IDE version and simply import this project in the IDE and compile it from there.

The obtained `.elf` file can be used to flash the board.
